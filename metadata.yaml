description: Written when James was 70, "A Small Boy and Others" is a dramatic monologue
  on a young boy's search for "the aesthetic clue." James finds his evidence in the
  refined reconstructions of his family life, his imagination, his travel, and his
  memories of the streets and neighborhoods of 19th-century New York. "A Small Boy
  and Others" is a very personal study of fate, memory, and the wonder of youthful
  conciousness and curiousity. It is also a love letter of sorts to New York City
  in the third quarter of the 19th century.
